The **R** package 'RLumCarlo' by Johannes Friedrich (University of Bayreuth, Germany) & Sebastian Kreutzer (IRAMAT-CRP2A, UMR 5060, CNRS - Université Bordeaux Montaigne, France) provides a collection of various R functions modelling luminescence signals in feldspar.

[![Project Status: Concept – Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](a href="https://www.repostatus.org/#concept">)
[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/RLumCarlo)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RLumCarlo)
[![Downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/RLumCarlo)](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/RLumCarlo)


## Installation

#### i. Requirements

Depending on your OS please download and install one of the following:

**Windows (32/64bit)** - 'Rtools' (provided by CRAN)

   http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

**Mac OS X** - 'Xcode' (provided by Apple)

   https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/

For **Linux** users *gcc* often comes pre-installed in most distributions. Should *gcc* be not available, however, we kindly refer to the exhaustive collection of installation guides depending on the linux distribution.

#### ii. Install the package

To install the latest development builds directly from GitHub, run

```r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RLumCarlo@master")
```

To install a developer build other than 'master', replace the term 'master' in the codeline by the name
of the wanted developer build (not available yet). 

## Examples

### Simulating CW-IRSL measurements

```{r}
run_MC_CW_IRSL(A = 0.12, rho = 0.003, times = 0:1000) %>%
   calc_RLumCarlo() %>%
     plot_RLumCarlo(norm = T, legend = T)
```

This is the same as the following lines:

```{r}
results <- run_MC_CW_IRSL(A = 0.12, rho = 0.003, times = 0:1000)
calc <- calc_RLumCarlo(results) 
plot_RLumCarlo(calc, norm = T, legend = T)
```

## Note

**The package comes without any guarantee!**

Please further note that this version is a development version and may change day by day. For stable branches please visit the package on CRAN.
