# RLumCarlo <img width=120px src="man/figures/Logo_RLumCarlo.png" align="right" />

The **R** package ‘RLumCarlo’ by Johannes Friedrich (University of
Bayreuth, Germany) & Sebastian Kreutzer (IRAMAT-CRP2A, UMR 5060, CNRS -
Université Bordeaux Montaigne, France) provides a collection of various
R functions modelling luminescence signals using Monte Carlo methods

## Installation

#### i. Requirements

Depending on your OS please download and install one of the following:

**Windows (32/64bit)** - ‘Rtools’ (provided by CRAN)

<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

**Mac OS X** - ‘Xcode’ (provided by Apple)

<https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/>

For **Linux** users *gcc* often comes pre-installed in most
distributions. Should *gcc* be not available, however, we kindly refer
to the exhaustive collection of installation guides depending on the
linux distribution.

#### ii. Install the package

To install the latest development builds directly from GitHub, run

``` r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RLumCarlo@master")
```

To install a developer build other than ‘master’, replace the term
‘master’ in the codeline by the name of the wanted developer build
(not available yet).

## Examples

### Simulating CW-IRSL measurements

``` r
run_MC_CW_IRSL_TUN(A = 0.12, rho = 0.003, times = 0:1000) %>%
     plot_RLumCarlo(norm = T, legend = T)
#>       time           mean            y_min            y_max
