# RLumCarlo <img width=120px src="man/figures/Logo_RLumCarlo.png" align="right" />

The **R** package ‘RLumCarlo’ provides a collection of R functions
modelling luminescence production in isolators and semiconductors for
various stimulation modes using Monte Carlo methods.

  - ~~Documentation checked by Christoph?~~

  - ~~Documentation verified by Vasilis?~~

  - Vignette checked by Vasilis?

  - Vignette checked by Christoph?

### Others

  - Check vignette and update vignette
  - ~~Write CRAN comments~~
  - Double check ORCID for authors
  - Double check DESCIRPTION file
  - Set proper version number

### Last steps

  - Delete this list but follow-up the things below
  - run WIN-builder tests for all releases
  - run as-CRAN
  - Are all CI tests green
  - Set up webpage for RLumCarlo
  - Make sure that the repository is public before the CRAN submission,
    otherwise the links will not work
  - CRAN submission
  - Add the usual GitHub community things

## Installation

#### i. Requirements

Depending on your OS please download and install one of the following:

**Windows (32/64bit)** - ‘Rtools’ (provided by CRAN)

<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

**Mac OS X** - ‘Xcode’ (provided by Apple)

<https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/>

For **Linux** users *gcc* often comes pre-installed in most
distributions. Should *gcc* be not available, however, we kindly refer
to the exhaustive collection of installation guides depending on the
linux distribution.

#### ii. Install the package from GitHub

``` r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RLumCarlo@master")
```

## Examples

``` r
run_MC_CW_IRSL_TUN(A = 0.12, rho = 0.003, times = 0:1000) %>%
     plot_RLumCarlo(norm = TRUE, legend = TRUE)
```

## <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-euro"></span> Funding

This project benefitted from support by various funding bodies.

  - The initial work by Johannes Friedrich, Sebastian Kreutzer and
    Christoph Schmidt was supported by the [DFG (2015–2018,
    SCHM 3051/4-1, “Modelling quartz luminescence signal dynamics
    relevant for dating and dosimetry”, SCHM
    3051/4-1)](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/279969851).

  - Later financial support was secured through the project *ULTIMO:
    Unifying Luminescence Models of quartz and feldspar (German Academic
    Exchange Service) DAAD: Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst DAAD
    PPP USA 2018, ID: 57387041)*.

  - The work of Sebastian Kreutzer as maintainer of the package was
    supported by [LabEx LaScArBx (ANR -
    n. ANR-10-LABX-52)](https://lascarbx.labex.u-bordeaux.fr).
